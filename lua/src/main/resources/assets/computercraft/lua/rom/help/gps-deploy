This program assumes that the turtle is facing positive Z.
You can either deploy getting the coordinates from existing
GPS satellites with `gps-deploy locate` or by manually by
specifying `gps-deploy X Z`. The satellites will be deployed
at the top of the world (the first height that a turtle
cannot move, minus one block)
